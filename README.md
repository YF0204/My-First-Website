# My First Website

Hey there! This website here was the first one I ever created whilst studying at university. It was for my module called Business Technology. The assignment required me to create an informative website for new students, from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The technology used is not the latest as this was a while back but I very much enjoyed working on it and makes me feel nostalgic. Please check it out and let me know what you think.

Many Thanks
