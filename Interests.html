	<h2> <em> A Little Bit About Me </em> </h2>
	<p> As mentioned before, Hi! My name is Yaseen Fulat, I am 21 years old and I live in Walsall. My hobbies and interests including
	playing and watching various sports such as Football, Tennis and Badminton. I also love watching movies, playing video games and travelling.
	After completing my level 3 IT apprenticeship, I decided to apply for a Computing degree qualification. I accepted the offer I received from
	Leicester De Montfort University as I really enjoyed my open day and the location. Currently, I have almost finished my first year and I cannot wait
	to start the next year, that's if I pass! </p>

	<h2> <em> My Computing Knowledge </em> </h2>
	<p> Since I was at high school, I have always been interested in Computing and Technology. I studied GCSE IT, then I moved onto a level 2 and 3 apprenticeship.
	During this time, I became more confident and learnt how to create websites using Adobe Dreamweaver, word & spreadsheet processing using Microsoft Word & Excel, building PCs from scratch and so on.
	After completing my level 3 apprenticeship, I worked for a small company where I mainly had admin and basic IT duties. However, I noticed after a while that this work was just not for me, 
	therefore I decided to apply for university to enhance my skills and find a more better and interesting job. </p>
