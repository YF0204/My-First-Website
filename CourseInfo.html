	<h2> <em> About the Modules </em> </h2>
	<p> Business Technology is the module where you will learn technical and creative aspects of computing.
	You will be taught how to construct a website using HTML and CSS, as well as using popular business software
	such as Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint. </p> 
	
	<p> The next module is Visual Web Development. This module shows you the fundamentals of programming. You will use
	a program called Microsoft Visual Studio to create a website that can add, edit and delete data. Programming is one of the most
	trickiest aspects of computing but this module will help greatly. </p>
	
	<br>
	
	<img src="Images/html.jpg" alt="HTML Image" id="HTML">
	
	<p> Database Management and Reporting provides students an understanding of how data is modelled in a management system. You will be designing
	database by working with Entity-Relationship diagrams and again using Visual Studio to implement these designs. </p>
	
	<p> The last module you will be studying is Information Systems Development. This is quite possibly the most complex module because you will be
	required to create a working computer system. In this module, you will be shown the many tasks that need to be complete in order to carry out such a
	project. All of this, may sound challenging but will help you in the future. </p>
